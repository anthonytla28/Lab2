 **Lab2**
 
 By: Anthony Tlatenchi

This program is designed to read in a csv fill from Spotify charts the one I chose is a viral 50 chart from the week of August 27 of this year. Using this csv file the program takes on the task of receiving all the artist that appear and sending those results to a output file sorted alphabetically and with no duplicates also below each artist name is the number of times they appear.


**Installation**

If you wish to compile my program I would recommond using an IDE with Java 8 beacause that is what I used to create the program and from thier you can simply paste the code into the IDE. To get a csv file you can go to Spotify Charts or use the one provided in the Data folder.

**Dependencies** 

* Java 8
 
**Folder Structure**

* Main Code in src folder 
* Input and Output text file in Data folder
