This program is designed to read in a csv fill from Spotify charts the one I chose is a viral 50 chart from the week of August 27 of this year. Using this csv file the program takes on the task of receiving all the artist that appear and sending those results to a output file sorted alphabetically and with no duplicates also below each artist name is the number of times they appear.
